# Aurorawatch Pipeline
This folder contains the code for the Aurorawatch data pipeline. This includes `extract.py`, `transform.py`, `load.py` and `pipeline.py`. This pipeline uses the `requests` library to send HTML GET requests to the [Aurorawatch UK API](https://aurorawatch.lancs.ac.uk/api-info/0.2/), the `xml` library to parse and transform the received data and finally the `psycopg2` library to load this data onto our database.
