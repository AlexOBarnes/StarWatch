# Astronomy API Pipeline
This folder contains the code for the `Astronomy API` data pipeline. This includes `extract.py`, `transform.py`, `load.py` and `pipeline.py`. This pipeline uses the `requests` library to send HTML GET requests to the [Astronomy API](https://docs.astronomyapi.com/) and the `psycopg2` library to load this data onto our database.
