# StarWatch

## Background
#### Problem statement
There are too many different sources of information about the night sky for amateur astronomers.

For example, imagine you are an amateur astronomer who is thinking about stargazing tonight. You might use a Night Sky app to find out what celestial bodies (planets/stars/etc) are in the sky at night, but then you also check the weather forecast to make sure it isn’t cloudy or raining tonight. Then, you have to find a way to check when the sun sets and rises or what phase the moon is in (so you know when it’s dark enough to stargaze). Then wouldn’t it also be cool to find out if there is Aurora activity or a meteor shower tonight?

All of this info may be available to the general public, but it is incredibly inconvenient to have to download many mobile apps, or navigate through various websites, just to get prepared for a night of astronomy.

## Project Goal
A dashboard or website which may include:
- Night Sky forecast (e.g. star charts and weather)
- Aurora activity
- Upcoming events (e.g. meteor shower or solar eclipse)
- Analysis of past events (e.g. how frequently has X planet been visible from Y region in the past month)
Email or phone alerts for subscribers:
- For sudden spikes in aurora activity
- Ahead of time alerts - e.g. “Jupiter will be very visible in your location in an hour”
